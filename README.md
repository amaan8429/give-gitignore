# give-gitignore

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/your-package-name.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/give-gitignore)

This is a Node.js command-line tool that generates a `.gitignore` file for your project. It checks if a `.gitignore` file already exists and, if so, asks the user if they want to overwrite it. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one using a sample standard gitignore file

## Installation

To install this package globally, use npm:

```bash
npm install -g give-gitignore
```

Certainly! Below is a README template that you can use for your TypeScript project. Make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual details of your project.

## Usage

Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
give-gitignore
```

This command will generate a gitignore in the root directory and if the file already exists, it will ask you if you want to overwrite it.

## Features

- Checks if a `.gitignore` file already exists in the current directory.
- If the file exists, it asks the user if they want to overwrite it.
- If the file does not exist, it creates a new one with a sample standard gitignore file.
